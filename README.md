#### By Max Osborne

## Description

This is a humor site parodying my ideal concept of a game store, which would
provide repair/modding/cleaning services via a workbench or workshop, it's
pretty rare to find a store that provides modding services or repairs, some of
which are necessary for some consoles and cartridges to continue living.

The website is mostly an excuse to make dumbr retro gaming jokes, and exude
an extreme air of incompetence, using extremely stupid tools to fix your rare
and valuable consoles/games.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Repairing consoles the MANLY way.
* Millions of copies of Anticipation
* Ultimate Cartridge Cleaning Guide
* "Gee... It sure is boring around here..."
