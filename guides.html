    <h1 class="titletext">Cleaning your games!</h1>

    <p class="instructions">In this guide we will show you how to properly clean a game cartridge, remember DO NOT use alcohol and a Q-Tip, that's for sissies.</p>

    <h2 class="methodtitle">Tumble and Dry</h2>

    <p class="instructions">Got dirty contacts on your cartridge? Throw it in with the laundry, and watch those contacts come out sparkling clean.</p>

    <h2 class="methodtitle">Sand it down</h2>

    <p class="instructions">My daddy said every man needs a belt sander, this is the fastest most expedited and dangerous way to clean your cartridge.</p>

    <ol class="instructions">
      <li>In order to open up the cartridge you should use a phillips head screwdriver, if they've got security bits drill the screws out.</li>
      <li>Remove the PCB from the plastic shell.</li>
      <li>Turn on the belt sander.</li>
      <li>Apply PCB contacts to belt sander, and watch that grime get sanded right off, and admire the sparkling contacts.</li>
      <li>If you drilled out your 3.8mm security screws do not fear, Hot Glue Gun to the Rescue! The contacts are now so clean you won't need to open it again.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="methodtitle">Pressure Wash</h2>

    <p class="instructions">Much like the Belt Sander the over the top industrial strength of a pressure washer is pretty awesome. It's pretty simple really, just place your game on the ground, and chase it around with the pressure washer after about a good 10 minutes of this the game should be clean.</p>

    <h2 class="methodtitle">Blow it!!(Duh!)</h2>

    <p class="instructions">Blowing on cartridges gets saliva on them, and saliva is technically a solvent, because it is mostly water. Contrary to what collectors will tell you saliva DOES NOT stick to the contacts and dry making it dirtier, leaving a disgusting black residue from the buildup of loogie.</p>
